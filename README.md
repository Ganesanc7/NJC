# NJC
I made two different files,name that creating databese and creating table which are attached blow.

#Creating Database
  here,
    Imported mysql-connector in python.
    Created a connection between mysql and python.
    Created a Database with name 'njc'.

#Creating Table
    here,
    Created a Table named 'movie' under the 'njc' Database. 
    Inserted many rows in the table.
    print all the rows in single query.
    Retrieved only some of rows information using differnt conditions.
